## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a novice fantasy football player in an ESPN league, I want an AI assistant manager that can analyze my league and team data, stay updated on NFL news and fantasy analysis, and make or recommend trades, roster changes, and other decisions so I can compete more effectively with my friends.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a novice user first opens the app, **When** they connect their ESPN league credentials, **Then** the system authenticates and displays their current team roster, league standings, and upcoming opponent.

2. **Given** the AI agent analyzes the user's team, **When** it identifies potential lineup improvements, **Then** it presents specific start/sit recommendations with explanations like "Start Player X over Player Y because X has a better matchup against a weak run defense."

3. **Given** a player on the user's roster gets injured during a game, **When** the AI agent detects this news, **Then** it immediately notifies the user and suggests replacement options from available free agents or bench players.

4. **Given** the user wants to make a trade, **When** they ask the AI agent for trade suggestions, **Then** it analyzes all league teams and proposes specific trade scenarios with fair value assessments and explanations.

5. **Given** it's Tuesday (waiver wire day), **When** the AI agent reviews available players, **Then** it prioritizes waiver claims based on the user's team needs and provides a recommended pickup order.

6. **Given** the user receives a trade offer from another manager, **When** they ask the AI agent for advice, **Then** it evaluates the trade's impact on their team's projected performance and recommends accept/decline with reasoning.

7. **Given** lineup lock is approaching (Sunday morning), **When** the AI agent performs final analysis, **Then** it sends a push notification with any last-minute lineup changes based on injury reports or weather updates.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when ESPN API access is lost or credentials expire? System should gracefully handle authentication failures and prompt for re-login.
- How does the system handle conflicting advice from different news sources? Prioritize tier-1 sources (ESPN, NFL.com) over social media.
- What if the user ignores or overrides AI recommendations repeatedly? Track override patterns and learn user preferences.
- How does the agent handle incomplete or missing league data? Use conservative estimates and clearly indicate data limitations.
- What happens if a player is ruled out minutes before kickoff? Send emergency notifications and suggest immediate replacements.
- How does the system handle bye weeks and playoff schedules? Proactively plan roster moves weeks in advance.
- What if multiple users in the same league use the advisor? Ensure recommendations don't benefit one user at another's expense.
- How does the agent handle dynasty vs. redraft league differences? Adjust recommendation algorithms based on league type.
- What happens during NFL trade deadline or free agency periods? Increase monitoring frequency and adjust player valuations in real-time.
