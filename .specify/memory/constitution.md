# ESPN API Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
Every contribution MUST maintain high code quality standards. Code MUST be readable, maintainable, and follow Python best practices. All functions MUST have clear docstrings, type hints where applicable, and meaningful variable names. Code complexity MUST be justified - if a function exceeds 20 lines or 3 levels of nesting, it MUST be refactored or documented with rationale.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. Every new feature MUST have corresponding unit tests, integration tests for API interactions, and contract tests for external ESPN API compatibility. Test coverage MUST maintain minimum 80% threshold.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All public APIs MUST follow consistent naming conventions, parameter patterns, and return formats across all sports modules. Error messages MUST be descriptive and actionable. Documentation MUST be comprehensive with clear examples. Breaking changes to public APIs MUST follow semantic versioning and include migration guides.

### IV. API Integration Stability
External ESPN API changes MUST be handled gracefully with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. All API interactions MUST include retry logic with exponential backoff. Rate limiting MUST be respected. API responses MUST be validated against expected schemas. Deprecated ESPN endpoints MUST be tracked and migration paths documented.

### V. Backward Compatibility
Public API changes MUST maintain backward compatibility within major versions. Deprecated features MUST provide clear warnings and migration paths. Breaking changes MUST only occur in major version bumps with comprehensive migration documentation.

## API Integration Standards

### ESPN API Contract Management
- All ESPN API endpoints MUST be documented with expected request/response schemas
- Contract tests MUST validate API compatibility on every release
- API version changes MUST be tracked and communicated to users
- Fallback mechanisms MUST be implemented for critical data endpoints

### Error Handling & Resilience
- Network timeouts MUST be configurable with sensible defaults
- API failures MUST provide meaningful error messages to users
- Retry logic MUST be implemented for transient failures
- Circuit breaker patterns MUST be considered for external dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
- All PRs MUST pass automated tests and linting checks
- Code reviews MUST verify compliance with constitution principles
- API changes MUST include integration tests
- Documentation MUST be updated for any public API modifications

### Testing Gates
- Unit tests MUST pass for all new code
- Integration tests MUST validate ESPN API compatibility
- Contract tests MUST ensure API schema compliance
- Performance tests MUST validate response time requirements

### Release Process
- Version bumps MUST follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Breaking changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Deprecated features MUST include migration timelines
- Release notes MUST highlight API stability and compatibility

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Complexity must be justified with clear rationale. Use README.md and project documentation for runtime development guidance.
